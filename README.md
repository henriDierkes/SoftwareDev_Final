# Software Development Final Project
Final project for the course Software Development

Aim
- Perform linear spectral mixture analysis (LSMA) using respective python libraries & packages
    - Automatically extract endmember spectra from image 
    - Maybe compare results from endmember spectra derived from the image to spectra from field data (ASD measurements)
- Maybe explore also Multiple Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA)
- Make an interactive web application using streamlit.io to visualize the results and modify some parameters

Responsibilities
- LSMA part (Henrike & Kiarash)
- Web application (Edgar & Kiarash)

Due date
- 15th July 2022

Expected time effort
- Kiarash: 20h
- Edgar: 20h
- Henrike: 20h 

Expected Outcomes
- Learning about the spectral mixture analysis
- Getting familiar with Python syntax
- Explore Streamlit to deploy applications
